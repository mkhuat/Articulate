#Articulate
The Text Analysis search bar accepts a URL from any news source and it then 
returns a word frequency list, a summary of the article, and the full article.

The Text Analysis search bar extracts the text from the URL source. Once the text
is extracted, the text is then processed to give the user a list of words that appear 
frequently througout the text, a general summary of the article, and then the article itself.
